# manageUsersApp API
    In this API we can register a user and displays the details of registered user
# A user is defined by:
     user name
     birthdate
    country of residence
# A user has optional attributes:

# Only adult French residents are allowed to create an account!
    When we try to create account for not adult french resident
    we will have http error and personalized error message

# Request samples
    In the "Postman collection" folder there are some samples queries to test the API (create, get all users, get user by id, ...)
    To do this you need to use the "Postaman" software and import the file then run the queries
